In this project I created a VBA macro that can trigger pop-ups and inputs, read and change cell values, and format cells.
Used for loops and conditionals to direct logic flow.
Used nested for loops.
Applied coding skills such as syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
